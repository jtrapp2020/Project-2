# Project-2
This project explores the relationship between air pollution and sickle cell disease (SCD) health care utilization in Durham County, North Carolina. Using raw pollutant concentration data from the EPA air monitor at RDU airport (2018–2020), the goal is to process and clean the air quality measurements and conduct exploratory data analysis to inform future clinical research. The project includes a custom R function that imports and cleans the three annual pollutant datasets by renaming variables, standardizing date formats, addressing duplicate records, averaging multiple measurements per day, and correcting negative values. The cleaned data is used to create summary visualizations that examine trends in carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and PM2.5 concentrations across months and years.

All code, data, and documentation are maintained in this GitHub repository. The final report is written in RMarkdown and knits to a Word document with hidden code and polished, publication-quality graphics. The project follows reproducible research practices, includes thorough code commentary, and emphasizes clarity and interpretability in data visualization.
